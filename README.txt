Implementation of Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) Game

Two computer players compete to win the game. Initial moves are random otherwise the game
is always drawn.

Various versions are provided showing the transition from a Java version to a fully functional
Scala implementation.


Version 1
---------
Implemented in imperative Java style with unit tests in Java using TestNG


Version 2
---------
Same Java source code but with unit tests written in Scala using ScalaTest
Tests are DSL based and are more readable and informative


Version 3
---------
The Java source code is converted to Scala. No major refactorings are applied
other than to remove unecessary boilerplate code. Style is still imperative


Version 4
---------
A more Scala style implementation, built around immutable data structures, no null
values and the goal of cleaner and simpler code


Version 5
---------
A full Scala implementation using a functional programming style, higher order functions
and immutable data


Version 6
---------
An advanced Scala implementation that also adds Actors into the mix
